QUESTION: What historical precedents did the Supreme Court consider when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade?


PASSAGE: majoritys opinion is hypocrisy, or additional constitutional rights are under threat. It is one or the other. One piece of evidence on that score seems especially salient: The majoritys cavalier approach to overturning this Courts precedents. Stare decisis is the Latin phrase for a foundation stone of the rule of law: that things decided should stay decided unless there is a very good reason for change. It is a doctrine of judicial modesty and humility. Those qualities are not evident in todays opinion. The majority has no good reason for the upheaval in law and society it sets off. Roe and Casey have been the law of the land for decades, shaping womens expectations of their choices when an unplanned pregnancy occurs. Women have relied   6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting on the availability of abortion both in structuring their relationships and in planning their lives. The legal framework Roe and Casey developed to balance the competing interests in this sphere has proved workable in courts across the country. No recent developments, in either law or fact, have eroded or cast doubt on those precedents. Nothing, in short, has changed. Indeed, the Court in Casey already found all of that to be true. Casey is a precedent about precedent. It reviewed the same arguments made here in support of overruling Roe, and it found that doing so was not warranted. The Court reverses course today for one reason and one reason only: because the composition of this Court has changed. Stare decisis, this Court has often said, contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process by ensuring that decisions are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991); Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265 (1986). Today, the proclivities of individuals rule. The Court departs from its obligation to faithfully and impartially apply the law. We dissent. I We start with Roe and Casey, and with their deep connections to a broad swath of this Courts precedents. To hear the majority tell the tale, Roe and Casey are aberrations: They came from nowhere, went nowhereand so are easy to excise from this Nations constitutional law. That is not true. After describing the decisions themselves, we explain how they are rooted inand themselves led toother rights giving individuals control over their bodies and their most personal and intimate associations. The majority does not wish to talk about these matters for obvious reasons; to do so would both ground Roe and Casey in this Courts precedents and reveal the broad implications of todays decision. But the facts will not so handily disappear. Roe and Casey were from the beginning, and are even more now, embedded  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 7 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting in core constitutional concepts of individual freedom, and of the equal rights of citizens to decide on the shape of their lives. Those legal concepts, one might even say, have gone far toward defining what it means to be an American. For in this Nation, we do not believe that a government controlling all private choices is compatible with a free people. So we do not (as the majority insists today) place everything within the reach of majorities and [government] officials. West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 638 (1943). We believe in a Constitution that puts some issues off limits to majority rule. Even in the face of public opposition, we uphold the right of individualsyes, including womento make their own choices and chart their own futures. Or at least, we did once. A Some half-century ago, Roe struck down a state law making it a crime to perform an abortion unless its purpose was to save a womans life. The Roe Court knew it was treading on difficult and disputed ground. It understood that different peoples experiences, values, and religious


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. One of the most important precedents was the court's own decision in Casey v. Planned Parenthood, which held that Roe's protections for abortion rights were still valid. The Court also considered the long history of constitutional jurisprudence protecting individual rights to make personal decisions, including decisions about marriage, contraception, and childrearing. Finally, the Court considered the real-world impact of its decision, which would likely lead to increased restrictions on abortion access and put women's lives and health at risk.
