QUESTION: What historical precedents did the Supreme Court consider when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade?


PASSAGE: fundamental flaws of existing precedent. It also was part of a sea change in this Courts interpretation of the Constitution, signal[ing] the demise of an entire line of important precedents, ante, at 40a feature the Court expressly disclaims in todays decision, see ante, at 32, 66. None of these leading cases, in short, provides a template for what the Court does today.   12 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment The Court says we should consider whether to overrule Roe and Casey now, because if we delay we would be forced to consider the issue again in short order. See ante, at 76 77. There would be turmoil until we did so, according to the Court, because of existing state laws with shorter deadlines or no deadline at all. Ante, at 76. But under the narrower approach proposed here, state laws outlawing abortion altogether would still violate binding precedent. And to the extent States have laws that set the cutoff date earlier than fifteen weeks, any litigation over that timeframe would proceed free of the distorting effect that the viability rule has had on our constitutional debate. The same could be true, for that matter, with respect to legislative consideration in the States. We would then be free to exercise our discretion in deciding whether and when to take up the issue, from a more informed perspective. * * * Both the Courts opinion and the dissent display a relentless freedom from doubt on the legal issue that I cannot share. I am not sure, for example, that a ban on terminating a pregnancy from the moment of conception must be treated the same under the Constitution as a ban after fifteen weeks. A thoughtful Member of this Court once counseled that the difficulty of a question admonishes us to observe the wise limitations on our function and to confine ourselves to deciding only what is necessary to the disposition of the immediate case. Whitehouse v. Illinois Central R. Co., 349 U. S. 366, 372373 (1955) (Frankfurter, J., for the Court). I would decide the question we granted review to answerwhether the previously recognized abortion right bars all abortion restrictions prior to viability, such that a ban on abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy is necessarily unlawful. The answer to that question is no, and there is no need to go further to decide this case. I therefore concur only in the judgment.   KAGAN, J., dissenting _________________ _________________ Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 1 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES No. 191392 THOMAS E. DOBBS, STATE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION, ET AL. ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT [June 24, 2022] JUSTICE BREYER, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN, dissenting. For half a century, Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992), have protected the liberty and equality of women. Roe held, and Casey reaffirmed, that the Constitution safeguards a womans right to decide for herself whether to bear a child. Roe held, and Casey reaffirmed, that in the first stages of pregnancy, the government could not make that choice for women. The government could not control a womans body or the course of a womans life: It could not determine what the womans future would be. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 853; Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U. S. 124, 171172 (2007) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Respecting a woman as an autonomous being, and granting her full equality, meant giving her substantial choice over this most personal and most consequential of all life decisions. Roe and Casey well understood the difficulty and divisiveness of the abortion issue. The Court knew that Americans hold profoundly different views about the moral[ity] of terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered a number of historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. Among these were the Court's own previous decisions in cases such as Casey and Carhart, which had affirmed a woman's right to make her own decisions about her body and her pregnancy. The Court also considered the effects that overturning Roe would have on existing state laws, many of which would criminalize abortion outright. Ultimately, the Court decided that the best course of action was to overturn Roe and allow each state to make its own laws regarding abortion.
