QUESTION: What historical precedents did the Supreme Court consider when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade?


PASSAGE: requested by the defendant were practicable, desirable, and consistent with double jeopardy values); Craig v. Boren, 429 U.

S. 71 (1971), and other equal protection cases and social changes had overtaken any inconsistent suggestion in Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 464 (1948)); Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522, 535537 (1975) (recognizing as a foregone conclusion from the pattern of some of the Courts cases over the past 30 years, as well as from legislative developments at both federal and state levels, that women could not be excluded from jury service, and explaining that the prior decision approving such practice, Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57 (1961), had been rendered inconsistent with equal protection jurisprudence). Other overrulings occurred very close in time to the original decision so did not engender substantial reliance and could not be described as having been embedded as part of our national culture. Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000); see Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808 (1991) (revising procedural rules of evidence that had barred admission of certain victim-impact evidence during the penalty phase of capital cases, and overruling South Carolina v. Gathers, 490 U. S. 805 (1989), and Booth v. Maryland, 482 U. S. 496 (1987), which had been decided two and four years prior, respectively); Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996) (holding that Congress cannot abrogate state-sovereign immunity under its Article I commerce power, and rejecting the result in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1 (1989), seven years later; the decision in Union Gas never garnered a majority); Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 531 (1985) (holding that local governments are not constitutionally immune from federal employment laws, and overruling National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.

JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Appendix to opinion of BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ. to protect). The rest of the cited cases were relatively minor in their effect, modifying part or an application of a prior precedents test or analysis. See Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778 (2009) (citing workability and practical concerns with additional layers of prophylactic procedural safeguards for defendants right to counsel, as had been enshrined in Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625 (1986)); Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 227228 (1983) (replacing a two-pronged test under Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108 (1964), and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U. S. 410 (1969), in favor of a traditional totality-of-the-circumstances approach to evaluate probable cause for issuance of a warrant); Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1, 4 (1964), and Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 202 (1962) (clarifying that the political question passage of the minority opinion in Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549 (1946), was not controlling law). In sum, none of the cases the majority cites is analogous to todays decision to overrule 50- and 30-year-old watershed constitutional precedents that remain unweakened by any changes of law or fact.


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. In particular, the Court looked at cases involving sex-based classifications, which are subject to intermediate scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The Court also considered cases involving local governments' immunity from federal employment laws, and cases involving the right to counsel.
