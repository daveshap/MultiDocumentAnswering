QUESTION: What historical precedents did the Supreme Court consider when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade?


PASSAGE: test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these rules created their own problems. And the difficulty of applying Caseys new rules surfaced in that very case. Compare 505 U. S., at 881 887, with id., at 920922 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The experience of the Courts of Appeals provides further evidence that Caseys line between permissible and unconstitutional restrictions has proved to be impossible to draw with precision. Janus, 585 U. S., at ___. Casey has generated a long list of Circuit conflicts. Continued adherence to Caseys unworkable undue burden test would undermine, not advance, the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles. Payne, 501 U. S., at 827. Pp. 5662. (4) Effect on other areas of law. Roe and Casey have led to the distortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines, and that effect provides further support for overruling those decisions. See Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring in part). Pp. 6263. (5) Reliance interests. Overruling Roe and Casey will not upend concrete reliance interests like those that develop in cases involving property and contract rights. Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. In Casey, the controlling opinion conceded that traditional reliance interests were       Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 7 Syllabus not implicated because getting an abortion is generally unplanned activity, and reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions. 505 U. S., at 856. Instead, the opinion perceived a more intangible form of reliance, namely, that people [had] organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society . . . in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail and that [t]he ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. Ibid. The contending sides in this case make impassioned and conflicting arguments about the effects of the abortion right on the lives of women as well as the status of the fetus. The Casey pluralitys speculative attempt to weigh the relative importance of the interests of the fetus and the mother represent a departure from the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies. Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 729730. The Solicitor General suggests that overruling Roe and Casey would threaten the protection of other rights under the Due Process Clause. The Court emphasizes that this decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. Pp. 6366. (c) Casey identified another concern, namely, the danger that the public will perceive a decision overruling a controversial watershed decision, such as Roe, as influenced by political considerations or public opinion. 505 U. S., at 866867. But the Court cannot allow its decisions to be affected by such extraneous concerns. A precedent of this Court is subject to the usual principles of stare decisis under which adherence to precedent is the norm but not an inexorable command. If the rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy would still be the law. The Courts job is to interpret the law, apply longstanding principles of stare decisis, and decide this case accordingly. Pp. 6669. (d) Under the Courts precedents, rational-basis review is the appropriate standard to apply when state abortion regulations undergo constitutional challenge. Given that procuring an abortion is not a fundamental constitutional right, it follows that the States may regulate abortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered three historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v Wade. First, the Court considered the precedent set by the Plessy v Ferguson case, which upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation. Second, the Court considered the precedent set by the Roe v Wade case, which recognized a woman's right to abortion. Finally, the Court considered the precedent set by the Casey v Planned Parenthood case, which upheld the constitutionality of abortion regulations.
