Write a detailed summary of the following:

another half-century after women gained the constitutional right to vote in 1920, see post, at 15; Amdt. 19it was firmly established that laws prohibiting abortion like the Texas law at issue in Roe were permissible exercises of state regulatory authority. And today, another half century later, more than half of the States have asked us to overrule Roe and Casey. The dissent cannot establish that a right to abortion has ever been part of this Nations tradition. 2 Because the dissent cannot argue that the abortion right is rooted in this Nations history and tradition, it contends that the constitutional tradition is not captured whole at a single moment, and that its meaning gains content from the long sweep of our history and from successive judicial precedents. Post, at 18 (internal quotation marks omitted). This vague formulation imposes no clear restraints on what Justice White called the exercise of raw judicial power, Roe, 410 U. S., at 222 (dissenting opinion), and while the dissent claims that its standard does not mean Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 37 Opinion of the Court anything goes, post, at 17, any real restraints are hard to discern. The largely limitless reach of the dissenters standard is illustrated by the way they apply it here. First, if the long sweep of history imposes any restraint on the recognition of unenumerated rights, then Roe was surely wrong, since abortion was never allowed (except to save the life of the mother) in a majority of States for over 100 years before that decision was handed down. Second, it is impossible to defend Roe based on prior precedent because all of the precedents Roe cited, including Griswold and Eisenstadt, were critically different for a reason that we have explained: None of those cases involved the destruction of what Roe called potential life. See supra, at 32. So without support in history or relevant precedent, Roes reasoning cannot be defended even under the dissents proposed test, and the dissent is forced to rely solely on the fact that a constitutional right to abortion was recognized in Roe and later decisions that accepted Roes interpretation. Under the doctrine of stare decisis, those precedents are entitled to careful and respectful consideration, and we engage in that analysis below. But as the Court has reiterated time and time again, adherence to precedent is not an inexorable command. Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U. S. 446, 455 (2015). There are occasions when past decisions should be overruled, and as we will explain, this is one of them. 3 The most striking feature of the dissent is the absence of any serious discussion of the legitimacy of the States interest in protecting fetal life. This is evident in the analogy that the dissent draws between the abortion right and the rights recognized in Griswold (contraception), Eisenstadt (same), Lawrence (sexual conduct with member of the same sex), and Obergefell (same-sex marriage). Perhaps this is  38 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court designed to stoke unfounded fear that our decision will imperil those other rights, but the dissents analogy is objectionable for a more important reason: what it reveals about the dissents views on the protection of what Roe called potential life. The exercise of the rights at issue in Griswold, Eisenstadt, Lawrence, and Obergefell does not destroy a potential life, but an abortion has that effect. So if the rights at issue in those cases are fundamentally the same as the right recognized in Roe and Casey, the implication is clear: The Constitution does not permit the States to regard the destruction of a potential life as a matter of any significance. That view is evident throughout the dissent. The dissent has much to say about the effects of pregnancy on women, the burdens of motherhood, and the difficulties faced by poor women. These are important concerns. However, the dissent evinces no

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has overturned a lower court ruling that had struck down a Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The 5-4 decision, with the court's conservative justices in the majority, is a major victory for abortion opponents and a blow to abortion rights advocates. The majority opinion, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, acknowledges that the court's previous decisions on abortion are "entitled to careful and respectful consideration." But, he says, those decisions are not "inexorable commands" and there are occasions when they should be overruled. This is one of those occasions, he says. The majority opinion goes on to say that the Mississippi law is constitutional because it "reasonably reflects the State's interest in protecting fetal life." The opinion also says that the court's previous decisions on abortion "create[d] a right to abortion that is not rooted in the Constitution's text and tradition." The dissent, written by Justice Stephen Breyer, says that the majority opinion is "based on a fundamental misunderstanding of Roe v. Wade" and "threatens to override all 50 States' abortion laws." Breyer also says that the majority opinion "ignores nearly 50 years of precedent" and will have "real-world consequences for women's lives."
