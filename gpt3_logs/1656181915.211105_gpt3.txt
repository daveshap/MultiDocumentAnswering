QUESTION: What historical precedents did the Supreme Court consider when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade?


PASSAGE: predictive judgment and therefore undermines Caseys precedential force.5 In any event, although Casey is relevant to the stare decisis analysis, the question of whether to overrule Roe cannot be dictated by Casey alone. To illustrate that stare decisis point, consider an example. Suppose that in 1924 this Court had expressly reaffirmed Plessy v. Ferguson and upheld the States authority to segregate people on the basis of race. Would the Court in Brown some 30 years later in  5To be clear, public opposition to a prior decision is not a basis for overruling (or reaffirming) that decision. Rather, the question of whether to overrule a precedent must be analyzed under this Courts traditional stare decisis factors. The only point here is that Casey adopted a special stare decisis principle with respect to Roe based on the idea of resolving the national controversy and ending the national division over abortion. The continued and significant opposition to Roe, as reflected in the laws and positions of numerous States, is relevant to assessing Casey on its own terms.  10 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION KAVANAUGH, J., concurring 1954 have reaffirmed Plessy and upheld racially segregated schools simply because of that intervening 1924 precedent? Surely the answer is no. In sum, I agree with the Courts application today of the principles of stare decisis and its conclusion that Roe should be overruled. III After todays decision, the nine Members of this Court will no longer decide the basic legality of pre-viability abortion for all 330 million Americans. That issue will be resolved by the people and their representatives in the democratic process in the States or Congress. But the parties arguments have raised other related questions, and I address some of them here. First is the question of how this decision will affect other precedents involving issues such as contraception and marriagein particular, the decisions in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); and Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015). I emphasize what the Court today states: Overruling Roe does not mean the overruling of those precedents, and does not threaten or cast doubt on those precedents. Second, as I see it, some of the other abortion-related legal questions raised by todays decision are not especially difficult as a constitutional matter. For example, may a State bar a resident of that State from traveling to another State to obtain an abortion? In my view, the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel. May a State retroactively impose liability or punishment for an abortion that occurred before todays decision takes effect? In my view, the answer is no based on the Due Process Clause or the Ex Post Facto Clause. Cf. Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347 (1964). Other abortion-related legal questions may emerge in the  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 11 KAVANAUGH, J., concurring future. But this Court will no longer decide the fundamental question of whether abortion must be allowed throughout the United States through 6 weeks, or 12 weeks, or 15 weeks, or 24 weeks, or some other line. The Court will no longer decide how to evaluate the interests of the pregnant woman and the interests in protecting fetal life throughout pregnancy. Instead, those difficult moral and policy questions will be decided, as the Constitution dictates, by the people and their elected representatives through the constitutional processes of democratic self-government. * * * The Roe Court took sides on a consequential moral and policy issue that this Court had no constitutional authority to decide. By taking sides, the Roe Court distorted the Nations understanding of this Courts proper role in the American constitutional system and thereby damaged the Court as an institution. As Justice Scalia explained, Roe destroyed the compromises of


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. First, the Court considered the precedent set by Plessy v. Ferguson, which upheld the States authority to segregate people on the basis of race. The Court also considered the precedent set by Brown v. Board of Education, which overturned Plessy and held that segregation in schools was unconstitutional. Finally, the Court considered the precedent set by Casey v. Planned Parenthood, which reaffirmed Roe and held that a woman has a constitutional right to abortion.
