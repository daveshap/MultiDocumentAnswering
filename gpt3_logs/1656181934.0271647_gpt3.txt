QUESTION: What historical precedents did the Supreme Court consider when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade?


PASSAGE: training and beliefs led to opposing views about abortion. 410 U. S., at 116. But by a 7-to-2 vote, the Court held that in the earlier stages of pregnancy, that contested and contestable choice must belong to a woman, in consultation with her family and doctor. The Court explained that a long line of precedents, founded in the Fourteenth Amendments concept of personal liberty, protected individual decisionmaking related to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education. Id., at 152153 (citations omitted). For the same reasons, the Court held, the Constitution must protect a womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. Id., at 153. The Court recognized the myriad ways bearing a child can alter the life and future of a woman and other    8 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting members of her family. Ibid. A State could not, by adopting one theory of life, override all rights of the pregnant woman. Id., at 162. At the same time, though, the Court recognized valid interest[s] of the State in regulating the abortion decision. Id., at 153. The Court noted in particular important interests in protecting potential life, maintaining medical standards, and safeguarding [the] health of the woman. Id., at 154. No absolut[ist] account of the womans right could wipe away those significant state claims. Ibid. The Court therefore struck a balance, turning on the stage of the pregnancy at which the abortion would occur. The Court explained that early on, a womans choice must prevail, but that at some point the state interests become dominant. Id., at 155. It then set some guideposts. In the first trimester of pregnancy, the State could not interfere at all with the decision to terminate a pregnancy. At any time after that point, the State could regulate to protect the pregnant womans health, such as by insisting that abortion providers and facilities meet safety requirements. And after the fetuss viabilitythe point when the fetus has the capability of meaningful life outside the mothers wombthe State could ban abortions, except when necessary to preserve the womans life or health. Id., at 163164. In the 20 years between Roe and Casey, the Court expressly reaffirmed Roe on two occasions, and applied it on many more. Recognizing that arguments [against Roe] continue to be made, we responded that the doctrine of stare decisis demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law. Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 419420 (1983). And we avowed that the vitality of constitutional principles cannot be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them. Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 759 (1986). So the Court, over and   Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 9 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting over, enforced the constitutional principles Roe had declared. See, e.g., Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502 (1990); Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417 (1990); Simopoulos v. Virginia, 462 U. S. 506 (1983); Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476 (1983); H. L. v. Matheson, 450 U. S. 398 (1981); Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622 (1979); Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52 (1976).  Then, in Casey, the Court considered the matter anew, and again upheld Roes core precepts. Casey is in significant measure a precedent about the doctrine of precedent until today, one of the Courts most important. But we leave for later that aspect of the Courts decision. The key thing now is the substantive aspect of the Courts considered conclusion that the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed. 505 U. S., at 846. Central to that conclusion was a full-throated restatement of a womans right


DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. The Court noted that a long line of precedents, founded in the Fourteenth Amendments concept of personal liberty, protected individual decisionmaking related to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education. The Court also recognized valid interest[s] of the State in regulating the abortion decision, including important interests in protecting potential life, maintaining medical standards, and safeguarding the health of the woman. However, the Court struck a balance, turning on the stage of the pregnancy at which the abortion would occur. In the first trimester of pregnancy, the State could not interfere at all with the decision to terminate a pregnancy. At any time after that point, the State could regulate to protect the pregnant woman's health, such as by insisting that abortion providers and facilities meet safety requirements. And after the fetus's viability—the point when the fetus has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb—the State could ban abortions, except when necessary to preserve the woman's life or health.
