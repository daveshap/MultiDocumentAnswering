QUESTION: What historical precedents did the Supreme Court consider when deciding to overturn Roe V Wade?


PASSAGE: guidance about the difference between a due and an undue burden. But the three Justices who authored the controlling opinion call[ed] the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by treating the Courts decision as the final settlement of the question of the constitutional right to abortion.12 As has become increasingly apparent in the intervening years, Casey did not achieve that goal. Americans continue to hold passionate and widely divergent views on abortion, and state legislatures have acted accordingly. Some have recently enacted laws allowing abortion, with few restrictions, at all stages of pregnancy. Others have tightly restricted abortion beginning well before viability. And in this case, 26 States have expressly asked this Court to overrule Roe and Casey and allow the States to regulate or prohibit pre-viability abortions. Before us now is one such state law. The State of Mississippi asks us to uphold the constitutionality of a law that generally prohibits an abortion after the 15th week of pregnancyseveral weeks before the point at which a fetus is now regarded as viable outside the womb. In defending this law, the States primary argument is that we should reconsider and overrule Roe and Casey and once again allow each State to regulate abortion as its citizens wish. On the other side, respondents and the Solicitor General ask us to  10 Id., at 861, 870, 873 (overruling Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416 (1983), and Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747 (1986)). 11 505 U. S., at 874. 12 Id., at 867.    Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 5 Opinion of the Court reaffirm Roe and Casey, and they contend that the Mississippi law cannot stand if we do so. Allowing Mississippi to prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, they argue, would be no different than overruling Casey and Roe entirely. Brief for Respondents 43. They contend that no half-measures are available and that we must either reaffirm or overrule Roe and Casey. Brief for Respondents 50. We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly relythe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That provision has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right must be deeply rooted in this Nations history and tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). The right to abortion does not fall within this category. Until the latter part of the 20th century, such a right was entirely unknown in American law. Indeed, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three quarters of the States made abortion a crime at all stages of pregnancy. The abortion right is also critically different from any other right that this Court has held to fall within the Fourteenth Amendments protection of liberty. Roes defenders characterize the abortion right as similar to the rights recognized in past decisions involving matters such as intimate sexual relations, contraception, and marriage, but abortion is fundamentally different, as both Roe and Casey acknowledged, because it destroys what those decisions called fetal life and what the law now before us describes as an unborn human being.13  Stare decisis, the doctrine on which Caseys controlling  13Miss.

DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v. Wade. First, the Court considered the difference between a due and an undue burden. The Court found that the Roe decision placed an undue burden on the states and that the Casey decision did not achieve the goal of ending the national division on abortion. Second, the Court considered the fact that some states had recently enacted laws allowing abortion with few restrictions and that others had tightly restricted abortion. The Court found that the Mississippi law was a reasonable restriction and did not violate the Constitution. Finally, the Court considered the fact that the abortion right is fundamentally different from any other right that the Court has recognized. The Court found that Roe was egregiously wrong from the start and that its reasoning was exceptionally weak.
