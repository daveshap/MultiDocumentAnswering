(slip op., at 7), and as the Solicitor General agreed at oral argument, it should have been overruled at the earliest opportunity, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 9293. Roe was also egregiously wrong and deeply damaging. For reasons already explained, Roes constitutional analysis was far outside the bounds of any reasonable interpretation of the various constitutional provisions to which it vaguely pointed. Roe was on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided, Casey perpetuated its errors, and those errors do not concern some arcane corner of the law of little importance to the American people. Rather, wielding nothing but raw judicial power, Roe, 410 U. S., at 222 (White, J., dissenting), the Court usurped the power to address a question of profound moral and social importance that the Constitution unequivocally leaves for the people. Casey described itself as calling both sides of the national controversy to resolve their debate, but in doing so, Casey necessarily declared a winning side.

As Justice White later explained, decisions that find in the Constitution principles or values that cannot fairly be read into that document usurp the peoples authority, for such decisions represent choices that the people have never made and that they cannot disavow through corrective legislation. For this reason, it is essential that this Court maintain the power to restore authority to its proper possessors by correcting constitutional decisions that, on reconsideration, are found to be mistaken.

DETAILED ANSWER:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court considered several historical precedents when deciding to overturn Roe v Wade. The most important precedent was the Court's decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, which established the "separate but equal" doctrine that allowed for racial segregation. The Court later overruled Plessy in Brown v. Board of Education, holding that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. The Court also considered other cases that had overruled previous decisions, such as Mapp v. Ohio (which overruled Wolf v. Colorado), Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins (which overruled Swift v. Tyson), and Smith v. Allwright (which overruled Grovey v. Townsend). The Court also considered the fact that Roe was "egregiously wrong and deeply damaging" and that it had "fan[ned] into life an issue that has inflamed our national politics in general, and has obscured with its smoke the selection of Justices to this Court in particular, ever since."
